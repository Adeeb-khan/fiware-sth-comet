# Short Term History configuration variables.
# STH is configured defining the folowing variables.
# All variables are optional, so, if one of this variables is not defined
# default value is used.

# See https://github.com/telefonicaid/IoT-STH#running-the-sth-server
# for further information

# Note: is important to export environment variables with export

# The host where the STH server will be started.
# Default value: "localhost".
export STH_HOST="0.0.0.0"

# The port where the STH server will be listening.
# Default value: 8666.
export STH_PORT="8666"

# A flag indicating if the empty results should be removed from the response.
# Default value: "true".
export FILTER_OUT_EMPTY="cb_rs0"

# The temporal directory to be used by the STH to temporarily store files (right now .csv files) before returning them.
# Default value: "temp".

# The service to be used if not sent by the Orion Context Broker in the notifications.
# Default value: "orion".

# The service path to be used if not sent by the Orion Context Broker in the notifications.
# Default value: "/".

# The username to use for the database connection.
# Default value: "".

# The password to use for the database connection.
# Default value: "".

# The URI to use for the database connection.
# This does not include the 'mongo://' protocol part.
# Two or more host are comma separated.
# Default value: "localhost:27017".

# The name of the MongoDB replica set.
# Default value: "".

# The prefix to be added to the service for the creation of the databases.
# More information below.
# Default value: "sth_".

# The prefix to be added to the collections in the databases. More information below.
# Default value: "sth_".

# The default MongoDB pool size of database connections.
# Default value: "5".

# The write concern policy to apply when writing data to the MongoDB database.
# Write concenr more info: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/write-concern/

# Flag indicating if the raw and/or aggregated data should be persisted.
# Valid values are: "only-raw", "only-aggregated" and "both".
# Default value: "both".
export SHOULD_STORE="both"

# Flag indicating if the raw and/or aggregated data collection names
# should include a hash portion. This is mostly due to MongoDB's limitation
# regarding the number of bytes a namespace may have (currently limited to 120 bytes).
# In case of hashing, information about the final collection name and its correspondence
# to each concrete service path, entity and (if applicable) attribute is stored in a

# Data from the raw and aggregated data collections will be removed if older than the value specified in seconds.
# In case of raw data the reference time is the one stored in the recvTime property whereas in the case of the aggregated data the reference of time is the one stored in the _id.origin property.
# Set the value to 0 not to apply this time-based truncation policy.
# Default value: "0".

# The oldest raw data (according to insertion time) will be removed if the size of the raw data collection gets bigger than the value specified in bytes.
# Set the value to 0 not to apply this truncation policy. Take into consideration than the "size" configuration parameter is mandatory in case size collection truncation is desired as required by MongoDB.
# Notice that this configuration parameter does not affect the aggregated data collections since MongoDB does not currently support updating documents in capped collections which increase the size of the documents.
# Notice also that in case of the raw data, the size-based truncation policy takes precedence over the TTL one.
# More concretely, if "size" is set, the value of "exporeAfterSeconds" is ignored for the raw data collections since currently MongoDB does not support TTL in capped collections.
# Default value: "0".
export TRUNCATION_SIZE="0"

# The oldest raw data (according to insertion time) will be removed if the number of documents in the raw data collections goes beyond the specified value. Set the value to 0 not to apply this truncation policy.
# Notice that this configuration parameter does not affect the aggregated data collections since MongoDB does not currently support updating documents in capped collections which increase the size of the documents.
# Default value: "0".
